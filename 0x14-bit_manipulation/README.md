Here's a list of the files included in this project:

- `0-binary_to_uint.c`: This file contains a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- `1-print_binary.c`: This file contains a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- `2-get_bit.c`: This file contains a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- `3-set_bit.c`: This file contains a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- `4-clear_bit.c`: This file contains a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- `5-flip_bits.c`: This file contains a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
